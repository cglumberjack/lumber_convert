# Lumber Convert

Lumber Convert contains conversion scripts for images, video and audio.  It's designed to be an easy to use tool
for any kind of content creation.

It's designed with python 2.7-3+ in mind and is tested as such.  

It utilizes ffpmeg and imagemagick under the hood to drive conversion scripts.  

It should be noted that if you are using lumber convert on the back end of an app you will need to pay royalties to 
ffmpeg as your use base crosses a certain threshold.
